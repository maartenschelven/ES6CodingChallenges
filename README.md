# \<es6-coding-dojo\>

In this project we have a test folder with failing tests.
Please fix them one at a time by changing the /test/index.html

1. letconstandblockscope
2. arrowfunctions
4. defaultparams
3. restAndSpread
5. destructuring

If you are stuck you can check the solutions folder for the ... solutions.

## Testing with a visible browser

```
$ polymer serve -o
GOTO: http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/es6-coding-dojo/test/index.html
and you will see the results. Here it is also possible to add a debugger
for future inspection.
```

## Running Tests
